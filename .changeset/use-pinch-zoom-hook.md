New `usePinchZoom` hook exported from `@agent-native/core/client` for canvas-style editors. Wires trackpad pinch (synthesized as `wheel` events with `ctrlKey: true`) and 2-pointer touchscreen pinch onto a scrolling container, with cursor-anchored zoom-to-cursor support and configurable `min` / `max` percentages. The slides template adopts it on the deck-editor canvas; any template with a zoomable surface can drop it in by attaching the returned ref to the scroll container.
