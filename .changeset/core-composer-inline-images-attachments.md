`PromptComposer` + `TiptapComposer`: inline image attachments, attachment-only composer-mode sends, and active-voice cancellation on submit. Image files attached to the composer are now sent inline as `<uploaded-image name=… contentType=…>` data-URL blocks alongside the existing pasted-text / inline-text flattening. Composer modes (`/code`, `/research`, etc.) now also accept submissions with no text when attachments are present — the default prompt becomes "Use the attached context." and the attachments survive the wrap in the mode's prefix + `<context>` block. Every send / build intercept path also cancels any in-flight voice dictation so a late transcript can't land on top of the just-sent message.
