`useVoiceDictation`: cancelling while the transcription request is in flight now actually drops the response. Previously `cancel()` returned early for any state other than `recording` / `starting`, so once the network POST started, a cancel click was a no-op and the transcribed text would still be inserted into the composer after the user cancelled. The fetch handlers (both success and live-snapshot fallback) now check `cancelledRef` immediately after the await and bail without forwarding.
