`useDbSync` + server poll: per-key invalidation for application_state one-shot commands. The poll loop now emits one event per changed (key, owner) pair instead of a single `key: "*"` wildcard, and the client only invalidates `navigate-command` / `show-questions` / `__set_url__` queries when those specific keys actually change. Noisy app-state keys (template-specific UI state, per-tab flags) no longer wake the navigation / question readers on every poll cycle.
