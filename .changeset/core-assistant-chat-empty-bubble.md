`AssistantChat`: hide the empty user-message bubble when the text content is nothing but an injected `<context>...</context>` block. Previously, sending an attachment-only composer-mode message (e.g. `/code` with a file but no prose) rendered an empty grey bubble in the chat after the context tags were stripped. The message now skips the bubble + expand/collapse UI entirely when the only attachment is context; attachment chips still render above.
